This motivated me to try to find a solution that would get my children engaged in their oral hygiene routine. Furthermore, I wanted this solution to assure me that they had not only brushed, but they brushed properly.  From my experience, this concept sounded like a pipe dream. It also made me realize that if I was having this problem, and I worked in the dental industry, most households were probably having a hard time getting their kids to brush.</p>",
